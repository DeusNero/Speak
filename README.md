A mindful voice journaling PWA with a zen aesthetic. Capture thoughts and track habits through voice or text — designed for low-friction daily reflection.

## What it does

Speak is a personal journaling app that lives on your phone's home screen. Tap to speak, hold to write. Your entries are stored locally — nothing leaves your device unless you choose to export.

### Thoughts
Record voice entries or write them manually. Tag entries by mood (1–5), categorize with tags (Feel, Poetry, Habit), and browse them in a feed or list view. Filter by date range or mood.

### Habits
Track recurring habits with a dedicated system. Log entries via voice or text directly from the home screen — double-tap the main button to switch between Thought and Habit mode. Streak tracking shows your consistency with rolling 7-day stats and gentle inactivity nudges.

### AI Refinement
Optionally refine your raw entries with Gemini AI (gemini-2.0-flash-lite). The original text is preserved — you preview changes and accept or dismiss. Works for both thoughts and habit entries. Requires a personal Gemini API key configured in Settings.

## Design

Zen garden aesthetic with a sand-colored palette, Spectral typography, glassmorphism, and stone-in-sand button effects. The main button breathes with subtle ripple animations. Everything is designed to feel calm and intentional.

## Tech

Single `index.html` file (~230KB), no build step, no dependencies. Pure HTML/CSS/JS.

- Service worker for offline support
- localStorage for all data
- Web Speech API for voice recognition
- Gemini API for optional text refinement
- Installable via `manifest.json`

## Setup

1. Clone or fork this repo
2. Serve with GitHub Pages (or any static host)
3. Open on your phone and add to home screen
4. Optionally add your Gemini API key in Settings for AI refinement

## Privacy

All data stays on your device in localStorage. The only external call is to Gemini AI when you explicitly tap the refine button, and only the text of that single entry is sent. No analytics, no tracking, no accounts.

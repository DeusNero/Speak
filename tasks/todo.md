## Setup
- [ ] Create `Speak-dev` staging app — second GitHub repo (`DeusNero/Speak-dev`), GitHub Pages enabled, install as separate PWA on phone for testing before pushing to production. Reason: testing always happens on mobile, so we need a safe place to push and verify new features without risking breaking the real app and its data.
